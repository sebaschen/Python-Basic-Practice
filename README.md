## Command Line:
1. - What does the command line do?

        The commandline or terminal is a faster and more powerful and faster to maneuver your operating system by using a GUI 

    - what are these abbreviations in command line do?
        - what can 'Pwd' use in terminal?

            pwd(print working directory)

        - what can 'cd' use in terminal?

            cd(changing directory)

        - what can 'ls' use in terminal?
2. What is dynamic typing in here?
1. Course Instruction:
    - my note
        - It's okay to speed up if it's too slow for you
        - You can chunk the part
        - Use the exercise to understand if you understand or not, if u understand it.

- What is dynamic typing in here?

    Dynamic typing means that python can assign different types of values in each of the variables. Dynamic typing refers to when a language is more agnostic to data types until the program executes

    ```python
    ## For Example

    the_example = 5 
    the_example = True
    the_example = 'the other'
    ```

8. List comprehension:

- What is the difference between tuples and lists?

9. Dictionary:

- iterations

    values()

    keys()

    items()

10. the difference between is and == ?

- ans
    - == checks the equality of the value,
    - is checks not only the value, but also at same memory locations or not.

11. Iterators and Generators

- Iterators
- Generators
    - Every Generator is a iterator,
    - Genarator use yield
    - Generator function will keep track of the function
    - Generator will save a lot of memery

12. decorators:

    - Kaggle是一個以數據分析為主的競賽平台，最終目標是可以自己打一個比賽
    - 經典的平台：
    - Kaggle平台
